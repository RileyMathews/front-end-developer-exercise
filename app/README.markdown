# Implementation

## Structure
Backbone of the DOM structure comes from html in index.html. Animation is currently handled by the css scroll-behavior property (only works in firefox by default, is an experiemental feature in chrome and opera). A jquery animation can be written with more time that copies this behavior and works in more browsers. If javascript is disabled however this behavior can still be the events default behavior for browsers that support it. 

Javascript is used to generate the message in the user story for showing which friends are on a given step, and to make the navbar toggle classes on click.
